#JAWS - Just another Webpack Starterkit

##JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE DEVELOPMENT WORLD WAS SAFE FROM ANOTHER BOILERPLATE...

Was tired of having to copy webpack config files from one place to another when all I need is a basic Starting point (ES2015/16 with Babel).

JAWS aims to fix that.

## The way I use it?

No cloning of this repository - I aint got time for that. I just need some copy-pasta thing going on. So I just curl to a file that I can keep up to date and copy that to the clipboard.


##Templates

###ES2015 with Babel
