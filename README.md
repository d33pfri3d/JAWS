#JAWS - Just another Webpack Starterkit

##JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE DEVELOPMENT WORLD WAS SAFE FROM ANOTHER BOILERPLATE...

Was tired of having to copy webpack config files from one place to another when all I need is a basic Starting point (ES2015/16 with Babel).

JAWS aims to fix that.

## The way I use it?

No cloning of this repository - I aint got time for that.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaundunne/JAWS/master/webpack.config.js | pbcopy
```

Then just make a `webpack.config.js` and paste.
